TODO

	- Render manager (continuing). Introduce the concept of renderpass and resources per render-pass. But in OpenGL, I don't think that's a super-important thing other than a good mental model. Definitely useful in some other API like Metal or Vulkan.

	- Sort+Sharedmem based SPH

  - Box2D, particularly LF rendering.
  
  - That console thing.. yeah, remove it. ImGui's console widget should be better.

  - Explore global illumination.
